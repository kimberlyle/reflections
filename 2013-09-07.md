1. Although I've had little problems setting up the IRC on my desktop and the Virtual Box, I'm not sure I quite understand the reasons and mechanics behind everything. I think trying to understand what I'm doing AS I do it has been the most challenging. Even GitHub is still a little confusing for me to navigate through. I've tried to understand it more by going through the FAQs and asking around. It's helped but I'd still say I need to familiarize myself more with the website. 

2. It was when I was trying to understand GitHub. Someone explained it to me in simple terms the beginning of this week: "GitHub is used so that multiple people can collaborate on a code together and the revisions are all saved." You might have said that during class but I might have missed it. Anyhow, this concise and simple description really helped me grasp its function, and I would describe it the same way to someone unfamiliar to GitHub.

3. Look at other online resources. If information I'm looking for isn't where it's supposed to be, google it. (That's how I'm learning more about GitHub).
