1. I still find the problem of navigating through GitHub to be challenging, especially in the process of submitting Weekly Reflections. I guess I'm just confused about whether we're creating new markdown files in our Reflections repository and submitting each separate markdown file each week as a pull request? 

2. I'm really glad that we all got together as a class to discuss problems we're all facing and things we need from the instructor. It made me realize that we were all mostly on the same level and equally confused about many things we were installing. Like it was said in class, it would be great to have some sort of road map of what we're tackling every week. It'll also really help if the IRC on Adium created a log. (I know you said you would create one but where should we expect to find it?)

3. To be honest, I don't think I would have taken a different approach at all towards learning any of this material. Perhaps I would try to reach out to other people in my discussion and we can talk about what we're supposed to be doing.
