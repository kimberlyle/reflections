1. I thought the guest lecture from this Tuesday was extremely interesting. It's great to see statistics when it's employed in research outside the classroom and what kind of information it can give you. The most difficulty I had this week in class, was understanding Thursday's lecture. Part of me feels like this is probably because I haven't gotten an in-depth look at the upcoming earthquake project yet. My memory of Poisson processes was a little rusty but I think with a little review of Stat 134 material, I should be up to speed again. I'm actually really looking forward to this assignment. 

2. No "Aha!" moments this week but the Tuesday lecture was oddly and surprisingly inspiring. It really made me excited to apply skills I learn in statistics to actual research, and even the data collection process (as tedious as it probably is) seemed exciting to me. 

3. There's not much I would change about this week except arriving to class on time (sorry!!). I was also reminded that I needed to review concepts in probability and statistics.
