1. Somebody mentioned it in class on Thursday and I definitely agree. I think that's it's about time we as students start to get our hands dirty and start programming, and doing projects. Although I understand the need for everybody to be on the same page, those who are having difficulty should go up to office hours. I don't think it's fair to ask everyone else to wait up for them. The guest lectures we had last week really made me excited to start actually working. I think the material sounds really exciting and I'd love to start as soon as we can. I really love that our class has a warm environment to it and that the instructors genuinely care about each individual. That being said, we should start and those who are behind need to take responsibility to catch up. 

3. I realized that I don't understand much about the need for data reproducibility. You could explain to me its importance but because I've never needed it myself, I feel like there's a lot I'm missing. Often times when I tell people I'm a Statistics major, they go, "Oh wow, so you must know all about data science and that stuff," and to be honest I don't. I feel like learning all these small concepts in these classes aren't giving me a big applicable picture of Stats in the real world. Hopefully this class helps me with that.
