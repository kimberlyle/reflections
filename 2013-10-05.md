1. I'm a little unsure why I need to start up vagrant and iPython to do data wrangling for the assignment this week with the questionnaire. This is partly due to the class time we dedicated to discussing tools that each role would be using and I had the idea that we could use whatever tool we needed to organize and extract our data. I also think it would be great to have a place where we can post links for resources that can be helpful (tutorials, etc.)

3. Doing research on google on my own really helped me in understanding things about this assignment. For example, I had no idea what vim was until I googled it and then tried to understand the tool and its commands on my own. I'm starting to follow my own advice on looking at other resources if I get confused which is great.
