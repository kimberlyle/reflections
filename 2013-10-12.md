1. Even though we had one week to complete the assignment, I found that I learned more doing this project than I had for the past 2 weeks. One input I do have for the assignment is that it could have had more instruction. Office Hours seemed almost mandatory for us because I don't think we would have gotten anywhere without coming in over the weekend. Luckily we were able to meet up and put aside a lot of time for the project. Something we as a group should work on is better communication in terms of who's doing what, because at one point, two people were doing the same job. Other than that, I love our team dynamic, and that we help each other out rather than strictly sticking to our given roles. Something to add about that, I feel like it would be great if we could rotate roles every now and then. I don't want to just curate data the whole time. Another thing we could work on, is working together online in the cases where we can't meet. 

2. I'm anxious and a bit excited for the next project. I love where this class is going, and also, I'd like to add, that through this project, I finally understand how to use GitHub (yayy!)
