This weekend I met up with the rest of the newly-created Reproducibility team (Team R) with Wen, Arif, Tristan, and myself. Our overall goal is to check the reproducibility of all the other groups. It was difficult to plan ahead of time our schedule since many groups have not started/finished any of their work. Since the Quakers have finished their code already, our immediate SMART goal for this week is to check the reproducibility of that group's code, and make sure we can call R on that code from Python.

We were discussing what our overall group's responsibilities would be. What we're planning on doing is: 
(A) Making sure that each group is producing what they say they are producing. That includes figuring out *what* each each group's end goal is as well. Some are still unclear on what they want to do.
(B) Make sure we can call R or whatever tools/programs that the different groups are using
(C) Checking other group's works. This requires us to try to understand their job.

Personal goals of mine this week is to stay in touch with the Analyzer Group 1 that I was assigned to as a data curator and try keep up with what they've been working on. As the Reproducibility Team, in order to do our job, everybody not only needs to be doing their's, but they also need to be uploading everything to their Repository for us to see it. We need maximum transparency between the groups.
