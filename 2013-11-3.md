1. Going to office hours yesterday really helped me gain some insight more into the structure of our class project and what the future plans were. I'm pretty happy with my new group too because I feel like we're getting a lot of stuff done. In addition, I learned more about the resource of StackOverflow, which I always knew existed but didn't understand how it worked. Although I'm really glad I learned more about it in the end, I wish these resources were given to us in the beginning of the class. Something that would be great to have is a class website with a list of good resources (in this case would be the class repository). In addition, arriving 30 minutes late on Thursday really set me behind on what was going on, so I'm definitely going to getting to class earlier and on time. 

2. While I really like the collaboration of this project, I'm a little concerned of the way we're partitioning parts. There are times when I feel like it's hard to contribute because one person went ahead and did most of the work needed to be done. Usually I like projects where I get to work from beginning to end, but at the same time, I think this type of project is also good for me to experience because this is how most of the real projects going on are being done. Through collaborative effort. Anyway, concerns I have, is how much I can contribute. I feel horrible when I haven't done anything and as data curators, it's always difficult to do it as a group of even 4-5 people.
