1. Personal Goals: Lately I've gotten some clarity into what I want to try to pursue. The more we work with the Earthquake data and collaborate, the more I've begun to learn how much interest I have in data science and computer science. My personal goals have been to explore this new interest and read through the "Python for Data Analysis" book. I'm going to look at career opportunities regarding data. Just yesterday I also checked out the D-Lab down in Barrows Hall to explore other resources around campus. 

2. While I'm excited on what we're going to pursue next, I'm a little worried about joining a new groups even though it's something all the data curators decided to do. I get really anxious when I can't contribute so I'm hoping that I can find my niche somewhere in this new group. 

3. It seems like students have been making and writing a lot of really useful documents and outlines for our class, but it takes a lot of digging to figure out where these documents are (mostly scattered around different repositories). It seems most useful if we had it all in one place, specifically the Stat 157 repository. I know Laura Cunningham has some really awesome .md files on the class structure and a list of the different groups and their S.M.A.R.T goals.
